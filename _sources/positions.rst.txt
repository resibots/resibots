Interns & Master students
-------------------------

We hire a few interns every year to work on our research projects. Please send a resume (by e-mail at jean-baptiste.mouret@inria.fr) and a cover letter that describes **why** you are interested in our research topic and your background (in French or in English).

All internships are paid 508.20 euros / month when they are no national holiday, a bit less for the other months. They are full-time positions in the lab. We can help you to find an accomodation in Nancy.

The official language of the team is English: English-speaking international students are welcomed (and appreciated).

For all the internships, students are expected to have at least basic skills in:

- Machine learning
- Strong interest for robotics and hardware devices
- C++ programming (ideally, C++-11)
